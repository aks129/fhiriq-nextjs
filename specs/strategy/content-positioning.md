# Content Positioning Framework

## Overview

This framework defines how FHIR IQ will position content to differentiate from competitors while establishing authority in the AI + FHIR intersection.

## Core Content Positioning

### Unique Value Proposition in Content
**"Where AI Meets FHIR: Practical, Production-Ready Solutions"**

### Content Mission
Transform FHIR implementation from months of complex coding to hours of AI-assisted development, backed by real-world expertise and battle-tested playbooks.

## Competitive Content Landscape

### Current Market Positioning

#### Firely Content Strategy
- **Focus**: Technical documentation and standards compliance
- **Strength**: Comprehensive API docs and implementation guides
- **Gap**: Limited practical, real-world scenarios

#### Smile Content Strategy
- **Focus**: Enterprise white papers and compliance guides
- **Strength**: ROI calculators and business cases
- **Gap**: Lack of hands-on technical content

#### Vermonster Content Strategy
- **Focus**: Engineering blog posts and case studies
- **Strength**: Authentic technical deep-dives
- **Gap**: Limited FHIR-specific content

### FHIR IQ's Content Opportunity
- **Unclaimed Territory**: AI + FHIR intersection
- **Underserved Need**: Practical implementation playbooks
- **Missing Voice**: Data quality and post-implementation optimization
