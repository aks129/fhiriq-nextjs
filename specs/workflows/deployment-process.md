## Deployment Pipeline

### Stage 1: Development Deployment

#### Automated Triggers
```javascript
// Triggered by:
// - Code commits to development branch
// - Manual deployment request
// - Scheduled nightly builds

const DEVELOPMENT_DEPLOYMENT = {
  trigger: ['git_push', 'manual', 'scheduled'],
  environment: 'wix_studio_preview',
  validations: [
    'syntax_check',
    'basic_functionality_test',
    'lint_check'
  ],
  notifications: ['developer_slack_channel']
};
```

#### Development Validation
```
Pre-deployment Checks:
□ Code syntax validates
□ No console errors in browser
□ Basic page navigation works
□ API endpoints respond correctly
□ Database connections established
```

### Stage 2: Staging Deployment

#### Staging Triggers
```javascript
// Triggered by:
// - Successful development deployment
// - Manual staging promotion
// - Release candidate preparation

const STAGING_DEPLOYMENT = {
  trigger: ['development_success', 'manual_promotion'],
  environment: 'wix_studio_staging',
  validations: [
    'comprehensive_testing',
    'performance_testing',
    'security_scanning',
    'accessibility_testing',
    'mobile_testing'
  ],
  approvals: ['tech_lead', 'product_owner'],
  notifications: ['team_slack', 'stakeholder_email']

    availability: '> 99.9%'
  }
};
```

### Alert Configuration
```javascript

    site_down: {
      condition: 'availability < 95%',
      duration: '2m',
      notifications: ['pager_duty', 'slack_critical', 'email_team']

      condition: 'error_rate > 2%',
      duration: '15m',
      notifications: ['slack_alerts']
    }
  }
};
```

    'availability < 90%',
    'critical_functionality_failure'
  ],
  manual: [
    'business_decision',
    'security_incident',
    'data_corruption_detected'
  ]
};

export async function executeRollback(trigger, reason) {
  console.log(`Executing rollback due to: ${trigger} - ${reason}`);

  try {
    // 1. Stop current deployment
    await stopCurrentDeployment();

    // 2. Restore previous version
    await restorePreviousVersion();

    // 3. Verify rollback successful
    await verifyRollbackSuccess();

    // 4. Notify stakeholders
    await notifyRollback(trigger, reason);

    return { success: true, restoredVersion: previousVersion };

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Rollback failed:', error);
    await escalateRollbackFailure(error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Manual Rollback Process
```
Emergency Rollback Steps:
1. Access Wix Studio admin panel
2. Navigate to site versions/history
3. Select previous stable version
4. Confirm rollback action
5. Verify site functionality
6. Update team and stakeholders
7. Investigate and document incident
```
