# Spec-Driven Development Workflow

## Purpose
Define the development process for implementing FHIR IQ website features using spec-driven methodology with Claude Code as the primary implementation tool.

## Core Philosophy

### Spec-First Approach
1. **Specification Before Implementation**: Every feature begins with a detailed specification
2. **AI-Assisted Development**: Claude Code implements from specifications in iterative cycles
3. **Continuous Refinement**: Specs evolve based on implementation learnings and user feedback
4. **Living Documentation**: Specifications serve as both planning and reference documents

### Benefits
- **Clarity**: Clear requirements reduce implementation confusion
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all features
- **Quality**: Thorough planning leads to better implementations
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented specifications aid future updates
- **AI Optimization**: Claude Code works best with detailed, structured specifications

## Development Cycle

### Phase 1: Specification Development

#### 1.1 Feature Analysis
```
Input: Feature request or business requirement
Output: Feature analysis document

Process:
1. Understand business objective and user needs

```

## Claude Code Integration

### Optimal Prompting Strategies

#### Initial Implementation Request
```
Prompt Template:
"I need to implement [feature name] according to the specification in /specs/[category]/[feature-spec].md.

Please:
1. Review the specification thoroughly
2. Ask any clarifying questions about requirements
3. Plan the implementation approach
4. Begin with the foundational components
5. Test each component before proceeding

Focus on Wix Studio + Velo implementation following our design system and coding standards."
```

#### Iterative Development Prompts
```
Continuation Prompts:
- "Continue implementing the next component from the specification"
- "The current implementation has [specific issue], please resolve"
- "Add [specific functionality] as detailed in the spec"
- "Optimize the performance of [component] while maintaining functionality"
- "Add error handling for [specific scenario] mentioned in the spec"
```

### Claude Code Best Practices

#### Providing Context
```
Always Include:
- Link to relevant specification
- Current implementation status
- Any specific constraints or preferences
- Expected outcome and success criteria
- Testing requirements and methods
```

#### Iterative Feedback
```
Feedback Types:
- Functional: "Feature works but needs [specific improvement]"
- UX: "User experience should be [specific change] for better usability"
- Performance: "Loading time needs to be under [X] seconds"
- Visual: "Design should match [specific design system component]"
- Technical: "Implementation should use [specific Wix/Velo pattern]"
```
