### Quiz Sampler (Interactive)

#### Question 1: FHIR Fundamentals (Beginner)
```
**Question**: Which element is required in every FHIR resource?

A) id
B) meta
C) resourceType
D) text

**Correct Answer**: C) resourceType

**Explanation**:
Every FHIR resource must include a `resourceType` element that identifies the type of resource (e.g., "Patient", "Observation"). While `id` is highly recommended and required for most operations, `resourceType` is the only truly mandatory element across all resources.

**Code Example**:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",  // ← Required
  "id": "123",               // ← Recommended
  "name": [...]
}
```

**Study Tip**: Remember that FHIR follows a resource-centric approach where everything is a resource with a specific type.
```

#### Question 2: Search Parameters (Intermediate)
```
**Question**: How do you search for all patients with the family name "Smith" using FHIR search?

A) GET [base]/Patient?name=Smith
B) GET [base]/Patient?family=Smith
C) GET [base]/Patient?surname=Smith
D) GET [base]/Patient?last-name=Smith

**Correct Answer**: B) GET [base]/Patient?family=Smith

**Explanation**:
The `family` search parameter is the standard way to search for patients by family name in FHIR. The Patient resource defines specific search parameters for different name components.

**Interactive Query Builder**:
[URL Builder Interface]
Base URL: [base]/Patient?
Parameters:
☑ family = "Smith"
☐ given = ""
☐ birthdate = ""

Result: GET [base]/Patient?family=Smith

**Related Parameters**:
- `given`: First/given names
- `name`: Any name (family, given, etc.)
- `phonetic`: Phonetic matching
```

#### Question 3: SMART on FHIR (Advanced)
```
**Question**: What scope is required for a SMART app to read patient data?

A) patient/Patient.read
B) patient/*.read
C) user/Patient.read
D) system/Patient.read

**Correct Answer**: B) patient/*.read

**Explanation**:
SMART scopes follow the pattern `{context}/{resource}.{permission}`. The `patient/*` scope allows access to all resources for the patient in context. More specific scopes like `patient/Patient.read` only allow access to the Patient resource itself.

**OAuth 2.0 Flow Diagram**:
[Interactive Diagram showing SMART launch flow]
1. App launches from EHR
2. Authorization request with scopes
3. User consent screen
4. Authorization code returned
5. Token exchange with PKCE
6. Access token with granted scopes

**Scope Examples**:
- `patient/Patient.read`: Read patient demographics only
- `patient/Observation.read`: Read patient's observations
- `patient/*.read`: Read all patient data
- `user/Patient.read`: Read any patient (provider context)
```

#### Question 4: Advanced Implementation (Expert)
```
**Question**: When implementing FHIR Bulk Data Export ($export), which HTTP status code should be returned initially?

A) 200 OK
B) 201 Created
C) 202 Accepted
D) 204 No Content

**Correct Answer**: C) 202 Accepted

**Explanation**:
Bulk Data Export is an asynchronous operation. The server returns `202 Accepted` with a `Content-Location` header pointing to the status endpoint. Clients poll this endpoint until the export is complete.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```http
POST [base]/Patient/$export
Accept: application/fhir+json
Prefer: respond-async

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Location: https://example.com/bulk-status/123
```

**Status Polling**:
```http
GET https://example.com/bulk-status/123

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "transactionTime": "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z",
  "request": "[base]/Patient/$export",
  "requiresAccessToken": true,
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "Patient",
      "url": "https://example.com/downloads/patients.ndjson"
    }
  ]
}
```
```
