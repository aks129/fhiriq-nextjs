## SEO & URL Strategy

### URL Naming Conventions
```
Pattern: /category/subcategory/item-name

Examples:
✅ /solutions/payers
✅ /tools/app-builder
✅ /training/workshops
✅ /blog/ai-fhir-development-guide
✅ /case-studies/health-plan-implementation
✅ /docs/getting-started

Avoid:
❌ /solutions.html
❌ /tools/tool1
❌ /page-123
❌ /content/blog/post/article
```

### Canonical URL Strategy
```
Primary URLs (canonical):
- /blog/post-title
- /tools/tool-name
- /solutions/industry

Alternative URLs (redirect to canonical):
- /substack-import/post-title → /blog/post-title
- /legacy/old-tool → /tools/new-tool-name
```

### Internal Linking Strategy
```
Hub & Spoke Model:
- Solution pages link to relevant tools
- Tool pages link to relevant case studies
- Blog posts link to related tools/solutions
- Documentation links to tool pages
- Training pages link to relevant resources

Link Equity Distribution:
- Homepage: 30%
- Solution pages: 25%
- Tool pages: 20%
- Blog/Content: 15%
- Other pages: 10%
```

## Content Organization Strategy

### Topic Clustering
```
Cluster 1: FHIR Implementation
├── Pillar: /solutions/
├── Supporting: /blog/implementation-*
├── Supporting: /case-studies/
└── Supporting: /docs/getting-started/

Cluster 2: AI Development Tools
├── Pillar: /tools/app-builder
├── Supporting: /blog/ai-development-*
├── Supporting: /training/ai-workshops
└── Supporting: /docs/ai-tools/

Cluster 3: Data Quality
├── Pillar: /tools/data-quality
├── Supporting: /blog/data-quality-*
├── Supporting: /case-studies/quality-*
└── Supporting: /docs/data-validation/
```

### Cross-Linking Rules
```
1. Every page should link to 3-5 related pages
2. Tool pages link to relevant solution pages
3. Solution pages link to relevant case studies
4. Blog posts link to related tools and solutions
5. Documentation links to practical tools
6. Training pages link to relevant tools and docs
```

## Conversion Optimization

### CTA Hierarchy
```
Primary CTAs (Ember Orange):

- Start Free Trial
- Download Tool

Secondary CTAs (Cobalt Blue):
- Learn More
- View Demo

```

### Lead Magnet Distribution
```
High-Intent Pages:
- Pricing: ROI Calculator

```

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Mobile Navigation Priorities
1. Search (prominent placement)
2. Primary value prop (AI App Builder)
3. Core solutions (condensed)
4. Contact/booking (always accessible)
5. Account access (if signed in)

### Mobile Content Strategy
- Front-load value propositions
- Use collapsible sections for detail
- Prioritize CTAs above the fold
- Optimize for thumb navigation
- Minimize typing requirements

### Mobile Page Hierarchy
```
Critical Mobile Pages (full optimization):
- Homepage
- AI App Builder
- Primary solution pages
- Contact/booking

Important Mobile Pages (optimized):
- Tool pages
- Pricing
- Training hub

Desktop-Primary Pages (basic mobile):
